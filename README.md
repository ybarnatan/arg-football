# Argentinean Football League analysis 

### 📊 Aim & Goals
This project analyzes match data from the Argentinean football league (Primera División) for the period 2016–2022. The main goals are:

* To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical match data.
* To investigate the home vs. away performance effect.
* To apply the Poisson distribution to construct a basic statistical model for predicting match outcomes.

📌 **Key Insights / Highlights**
- 📈 Home teams scored more goals on average, confirming the **home advantage effect**.
- 🔍 Seasonal fluctuations in team performance were visualized and analyzed.
- ⚽ A basic **Poisson model** was implemented to estimate match result probabilities.
- 📊 Multiple plots and tables show team-level trends, goal distributions and other key stats.

### 🔈 Disclaimer
Football is often referred to as "a sport of marginal effects". This means that even strong statistical trends may not guarantee a favorable outcome. For example, a team might dominate a match in possession, expected goals, and squad value — yet still lose to a statistically weaker opponent. This unpredictability is part of what makes football both fascinating and analytically challenging.
