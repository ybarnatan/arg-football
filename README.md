# Argentinean football league analysis 

## ðŸ“Š Aim
The goal is to combine data from football matches from the argentinean league (period: 2016-2022) to perform exploratory data analysis, investigate the home-away effect on winning a match and applying the most basic discrete distribution (Poisson) in order to construct a basic thought helpful statistical model that may predict football results. Check the `LPF-2016-2023.md` file!

## ðŸ”ˆ Disclaimer
Football is "a sport of marginal effects", meaning that large trends may not consolidate on a favorable result. As an example, one of the teams may be highly dominating during the entire match, may have a more expensive staff, equipment and squad and still could be beaten by a "minor" team.
