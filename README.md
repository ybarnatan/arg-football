# Aim
The goal is to combine data from football matches from the argentinean league (period: 2016-2022) to perform exploratory data analysis, investigate the home-away effect on winning a match and applying the most basic discrete distribution -Poisson- in order to construct a basic thought helpful statistical model that may predict football results.

Disclaimer: football is "a sport of marginal effects", meaning that large trends may not consolidate on a favorable result. As an example, one of the teams may be highly dominating during the entire match, may have a more expensive staff, equipment and squad and still could be beaten by a "minor" team.
