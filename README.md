# Argentinean Football League analysis 

### ðŸ“Š Aim
The goal is to combine data from football matches from the Argentinean football league (period: 2016-2022) to perform exploratory data analysis and investigate the [home-away effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage). Also, weÂ´ll apply the most basic discrete distribution ([Poisson](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribuci%C3%B3n_de_Poisson)) to construct a basic thought helpful statistical model that may predict football results. Check the `LPF_arg.md` file for the entire analysis! (Code available in the `LPF_arg.Rmd` file)

### ðŸ”ˆ Disclaimer
Football is "a sport of marginal effects", meaning that large trends may not consolidate on a favorable result. As an example, in a match, one of the teams may be highly dominating during the entire match (in terms of possession, attempted goals, and so on), may have a more expensive staff, equipment and squad, and still could be beaten by a "minor" team.

### ðŸ’» Stack
For this project, I used R and R-markdown.
